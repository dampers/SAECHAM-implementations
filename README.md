## üìñ Overview

SAECHAM is designed for resource-constrained IoT devices and embedded systems. By restructuring the order of operations and rotation amounts of the existing CHAM-64/128 cipher, SAECHAM achieves enhanced security against differential and linear cryptanalysis and delivers faster encryption speeds across various MCU environments.

Key improvements of SAECHAM include:

* **Optimized Operational Structure**: After analyzing six possible operational permutation structures of CHAM, the most efficient structure (CHAM-RXA) was adopted to reduce the number of instructions in 8/16-bit MCU environments.
* **Enhanced Security**: Through an SMT solver-based automated analysis of 62 CHAM variants, SAECHAM was proven to have security equal to or better than CHAM64. It exhibits stronger resistance, particularly against differential cryptanalysis.
* **Superior Performance**: SAECHAM demonstrates superior performance compared to the original CHAM64 on all tested platforms, from low-power MCUs to high-performance CPUs using SIMD instructions.

#### üìÅ **For 8-bit AVR (ATmega128)**

This implementation is optimized for the Atmel ATmega128 MCU and is ready to be compiled using Microchip Studio.

1.  **Navigate to Directory**: Open the `AVR/` folder in your cloned repository.
2.  **Open Project**: Launch **Microchip Studio** and open the solution file (`.sln`) located in the directory.
3.  **Configure Toolchain**:
    * Connect your ATmega128-based board (e.g., via an STK600 or similar programmer).
    * Go to `Project > Properties > Tool` and select your programmer/debugger. Ensure the target device is set to ATmega128.
4.  **Build the Project**: Compile the code by selecting `Build > Build Solution` from the top menu or by pressing `F7`.
5.  **Flash to Device**: Upload the compiled firmware to the microcontroller by selecting `Debug > Start Without Debugging` or pressing `Ctrl+Alt+F5`.
6.  **View Output**: Open a serial terminal program (like Tera Term or the serial monitor in Microchip Studio), connect to the board's COM port, and set the baud rate to view the encryption results and performance benchmarks.

## üîê Security Analysis

SAECHAM has undergone rigorous security validation using automated analysis tools.

* [cite_start]**Differential Analysis**: The optimal differential probability for 39 rounds is $2^{-65}$, which is lower than CHAM64's $2^{-63}$, indicating higher security against differential attacks. [cite: 453, 460, 480]
* [cite_start]**Linear Analysis**: The optimal linear correlation for 36 rounds is $2^{-31}$, maintaining the same level of resistance as CHAM64. [cite: 430, 432]

[cite_start]For detailed round-by-round analysis results, please refer to Table VII and Table VIII in our paper. [cite: 485]
